## Running a public server

If you are able to run a public server, please [see the retrowars-server](https://github.com/retrowars/retrowars-servers/#contributing) project for more details.
Doing so will make it appear in the default retro wars client when searching for public servers, and ensure that people can continue to play against eachother even if the official servers are down.

### Running a server on Heroku

Before pushing to your Heroku app, make sure to set the following config:

```
heroku config:set GRADLE_TASK="-PexcludeAndroid stage"
```

Explanation: Newer versions of the Android Gradle plugin require an Android SDK to even configure the `:android` subproject of a libgdx project, not just to compile it.
To [avoid this issue, run the command above](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-gradle-apps-on-heroku#multiple-application-types-in-the-same-project) to tell Heroku that it doesn't need to worry about configuring anything except the `:core` and `:server` projects, and therefore it doesn't matter that the Android SDK is missing.

# Compiling

This app uses a the libgdx library and Kotlin. It is recommended to read the [libgdx documentation to get a dev environment setup](https://libgdx.com/dev/setup/).

Alternatively, you can import the project into Android Studio and build from there.
